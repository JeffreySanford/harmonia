DiffSinger failed; placeholder for: [Title] Null Again — Java Problems Satire <3 minutes, progressive rock / nerd humor>

[Vibe] (Energetic, dramatic, progressive rock with heavy riffs, electronic accents, comedic frustration)

[Sound Effects] (JVM hum, error beeps, clacking keyboard, sirens, wind, trash compactor, digital alarms, guitar solos)

[Lyrics]

[Spoken Intro] <ominous tone>
“You ever fix one bug and think you're safe… then the JVM whispers your name at 3am. NullPointerException… Null… Null…”

<Wind howling through server racks> (JVM fan spooling up)

[Verse 1]
I start the JVM, coffee’s gone cold, errors marching bold.
Simple class turns into a lecture, keyboard clacking, architecture.

[Pre-chorus] (alarm siren)
I import everything, compiler screaming “type mismatch!”
Unchecked cast hits like a bat crack in the night.

[Chorus] (error beeps)
Null again, null again, stack trace scrolling ancient scrolls.
Java eating up my soul, ominous choir sound.

[Verse 2]
Generics like cursed geometry, chalk screeching on a blackboard.
Cannot cast from T to ?, threads leaking like busted pipes, steam hiss.
Garbage collector like a trash truck slamming metal.

[Pre-chorus] (chains rattling)
Checked exceptions everywhere, try-catch nightmare.
Gavel slam, legal treaty coding.

[Chorus] <rising siren, dusty excavation>
Null again, null again, logs so long archaeologists dig, shovel digging dust cloud.

[Bridge] <dramatic arc>
Factory of factory of beans, echo chamber boom.
Annotations like arcane runes humming mystic energy.
Circular dependency screams feedback screech.
Spring pacing like an angry cat, hiss, memory footprint stomping like elephant.

[Solo] (intense energy)
Guitar shredding lightning, drum thunder cracks, synth waves crashing.
JVM CPU overload alarm.

[Final Chorus] <explosion>
Null again, null again, version mismatch metal clang.
Warnings fly like bats through doors.
Java, my beautiful monster, encore!

[Outro Spoken] (dying JVM whine)
“You think the build’s clean… but Maven updates a dependency. See you in the logs.”
