Lyrics:
male vocal solo, progressive rock style, energetic and frustrated delivery, powerful vocals with rock edge, comedic nerd humor:  I start the JVM, coffee's gone cold, errors marching bold. Simple class turns into a lecture, keyboard clacking, architecture. (Pre-chorus) I import everything, compiler screaming type mismatch! Unchecked cast hits like a bat crack in the night.  Null again, null again, stack trace scrolling ancient scrolls. Java eating up my soul, ominous choir sound.  Generics like cursed geometry, chalk screeching on a blackboard. Cannot cast from T to question mark, threads leaking like busted pipes, steam hiss. Garbage collector like a trash truck slamming metal. (Pre-chorus) Checked exceptions everywhere, try-catch nightmare. Gavel slam, legal treaty coding.  Null again, null again, logs so long archaeologists dig, shovel digging dust cloud.  Factory of factory of beans, echo chamber boom. Annotations like arcane runes humming mystic energy. Circular dependency screams feedback screech. Spring pacing like an angry cat, hiss, memory footprint stomping like elephant.  Null again, null again, version mismatch metal clang. Warnings fly like bats through doors. Java, my beautiful monster, encore!
