# Frontend scaffold (placeholder)

This folder will contain the Angular (Material 3 + NGRX) frontend.

Scaffold plan:
- `apps/frontend/` Angular app using strict NgModules (no standalone components)
- `libs/ui/` shared UI components
- `libs/state/` NGRX state slices and reducers

This is a placeholder; full scaffold will follow once Phase 0 is complete.
