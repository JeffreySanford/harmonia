NullPointerException… Null… Null…'\n\nWind howling through server racks, JVM fan spooling up.\n\nVerse 1:\nI start the JVM, coffee’s gone cold, errors marching bold.\nSimple class turns into a lecture, keyboard clacking, architecture.\n\nPre-chorus with alarm siren:\nI import everything, compiler screaming 'type mismatch!'\nUnchecked cast hits like a bat crack in the night.\n\nChorus with error beeps:\nNull again, null again, stack trace scrolling ancient scrolls.\nJava eating up my soul, ominous choir sound.\n\nVerse 2:\nGenerics like cursed geometry, chalk screeching on a blackboard.\nCannot cast from T to ?, threads leaking like busted pipes, steam hiss.\nGarbage collector like a trash truck slamming metal.\n\nPre-chorus with chains rattling:\nChecked exceptions everywhere, try-catch nightmare.\nGavel slam, legal treaty coding.\n\nChorus with rising siren and dusty excavation:\nNull again, null again, logs so long archaeologists dig, shovel digging dust cloud.\n\nBridge with dramatic arc:\nFactory of factory of beans, echo chamber boom.\nAnnotations like arcane runes humming mystic energy.\nCircular dependency screams feedback screech."
