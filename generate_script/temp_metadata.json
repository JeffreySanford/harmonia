NullPointerException… Null… Null…”\n\n<Wind howling through server racks> (JVM fan spooling up)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI start the JVM, coffee’s gone cold, errors marching bold.\nSimple class turns into a lecture, keyboard clacking, architecture.\n\n[Pre-chorus] (alarm siren)\nI import everything, compiler screaming “type mismatch!”\nUnchecked cast hits like a bat crack in the night.\n\n[Chorus] (error beeps)\nNull again, null again, stack trace scrolling ancient scrolls.\nJava eating up my soul, ominous choir sound.\n\n[Verse 2]\nGenerics like cursed geometry, chalk screeching on a blackboard.\nCannot cast from T to ?, threads leaking like busted pipes, steam hiss.\nGarbage collector like a trash truck slamming metal.\n\n[Pre-chorus] (chains rattling)\nChecked exceptions everywhere, try-catch nightmare.\nGavel slam, legal treaty coding.\n\n[Chorus] <rising siren, dusty excavation>\nNull again, null again, logs so long archaeologists dig, shovel digging dust cloud.\n\n[Bridge] <dramatic arc>\nFactory of factory of beans, echo chamber boom.\nAnnotations like arcane runes humming mystic energy.\nCircular dependency screams feedback screech.\nSpring pacing like an angry cat, hiss, memory footprint stomping like elephant.\n\n[Solo] (intense energy)\nGuitar shredding lightning, drum thunder cracks, synth waves crashing.\nJVM CPU overload alarm.\n\n[Final Chorus] <explosion>\nNull again, null again, version mismatch metal clang.\nWarnings fly like bats through doors.\nJava, my beautiful monster, encore!\n\n[Outro Spoken] (dying JVM whine)\n“You think the build’s clean… but Maven updates a dependency. See you in the logs.”",
