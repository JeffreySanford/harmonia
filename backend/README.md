# Backend scaffold (placeholder)

This folder will contain the NestJS backend scaffold.

Scaffold plan:
- `apps/backend/` NestJS application with modules, controllers, and services
- Strict DTOs and validation via `class-validator` and `class-transformer`

This is a placeholder; full scaffold will follow once Phase 0 is complete.
